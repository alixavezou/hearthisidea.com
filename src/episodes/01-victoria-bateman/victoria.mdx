Dr Bateman is a fellow in economics at Gonville & Caius college Cambridge. Her research encompasses economic history, macroeconomics, and feminism.

We begin by laying [why the Industrial Revolution was so important]() and why understanding its causes is key to understanding modern economic growth. We hear Dr Bateman explain the range of arguments economic historians have given for [why it was Britain that became the first industrialised nation]() in the world before delving into her own research about why she believes [fertility was a critical aspect]() to this that often gets neglected. We then draw out what lessons this has for developing countries today, particularly the [links between female empowerment and economic growth]().

## The Industrial Revolution and why it matters

> Is there some action a government of India could take that would lead the Indian economy to grow like Indonesia’s or Egypt’s? If so, *what,* exactly? If not, what is it about the “nature of India” that makes it so? The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: **Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.**

[00:04:30] Reflecting on the Industrial Revolution is reflecting on how new and still uncertain our relationship with economic growth is. Our World in Data has an excellent [article](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth) summarising this. The first thing to note is how a significant break the Industrial Revolution was with all of prior history: In GDP terms, there wasn't much going on before 17th Century Britain.

[00:05:25] Whilst nowadays a lot of people mock the pessimism Malthus described in "[An Essay on the Principle of Population](http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf)", the fact is that for much of human history he was right. An excellent, modern interpretation of Malthus with a formal economic model can be found in "[Malthus’s Theory of Population](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-21315-3_52)" by David Weir.

[00:06:30] Perhaps most relevant to today is the threat of environmental degradation. The Diplomat [writes](https://thediplomat.com/2016/11/chinas-tangled-environmental-history/) about how over extraction ended economic expansion in Qing Dynasty. Simillar warnings are now being given by organisations such as [The Club of Rome](https://www.clubofrome.org/).

[00:07:10] Another reason growth may be threatened is because inventing more and more new machines to make more productive is much more difficult than we are often led to believe. For example, Robert Gordon argues in "[The Rise and Fall of American Growth](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691147727/the-rise-and-fall-of-american-growth)" that the revolution in computer technology is much less productive than expected. In "[Why Nations Fail](http://whynationsfail.com/)", Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson note that one challenge is that 'extractive institutions' hinder innovations as this would hurt the rents of vested interests.

[00:08:48]  Another important thing to consider is that economic growth no longer ensures that everyone in society will be better of. Milanovic unpacks recent trends in inequality in his book "[Global Inequality: A New Approach](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737136)" whilst Walter Schneidel argues in "The Great Leveler" that the only times we have seen reductions in inequality during human history have been following violent shocks.
