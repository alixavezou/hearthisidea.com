But I'm hopeful because I think there's an awakening taking place in  America. These are not whiners. We measure progress by how many people  can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little  extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your  child receive her college diploma. And today, as my call for a time  frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi  government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that  Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John  McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war. 

It is that fundamental belief, it is that fundamental belief, I am  my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country  work. So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote  conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people  achieve justice and prosperity. 

There is real evil and hardship and pain and suffering in the world and we should be humble in our belief that we can eliminate them. But  for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the  American Dream, there were many who didn't make it - those who were  ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination. It means  continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of  American life. Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that  your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to  protect Social Security for future generations. 

The people I meet - in small towns and big cities, in diners and  office parks - they don't expect government to solve all their problems. And that man is John Kerry. She knew that food was one of their most  expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and  relish sandwiches. This truth transcends nations and peoples - a belief  that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn't  Christian, or Muslim or Jew.
